1. Minimum Required Win Rate (WR) for a given Risk-Reward Ratio (RR):
   Formula: WR = 1 / (1 + RR)
   Explanation: This formula calculates the win rate needed to break even, given a risk-reward ratio (RR).
   Example: If the RR is 2, the required win rate is WR = 1 / (1 + 2) = 0.33 or 33%.

2. Risk-Reward Ratio (RR) for a given Win Rate (WR):
   Formula: RR = (1 / WR) - 1
   Explanation: This formula calculates the required risk-reward ratio to break even, given a win rate.
   Example: If the win rate is 50%, the RR is RR = (1 / 0.5) - 1 = 1.
3. Expected Profitability (EP) or Expectancy:
   Formula: EP = (WR * Average Win) - (LR * Average Loss)
   Where:
   - WR = Win Rate
   - LR = Loss Rate (1 - WR)
   Explanation: This formula calculates the expected profitability per trade.
   Example: If the win rate is 40%, average win is $100, average loss is $50, the EP is: 
   EP = (0.4 * 100) - (0.6 * 50) = 40 - 30 = $10.

6. Risk of Ruin (RoR):
   Approximate Formula (simplified for fixed bet sizes): 
   RoR = [(1 - WR) / (1 + WR)] ^ Number of Trades
   Explanation: This formula estimates the probability of losing the entire capital after a certain number of trades.
   Example: If WR is 60% and you make 100 trades, RoR â‰ˆ [(1 - 0.6) / (1 + 0.6)] ^ 100.

7. Maximum Drawdown (MDD):
   Formula: MDD = (Peak Value - Trough Value) / Peak Value
   Explanation: This formula calculates the maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough during a specific period.
   Example: If the portfolio value dropped from $10,000 to $7,000, MDD = (10000 - 7000) / 10000 = 30%.
